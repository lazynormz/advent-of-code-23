# Warning:

There is a **lot** of bad practices in this repository. These simple scripts were **only** created for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) event.

# How to run:

To run any of the scripts of the day, simply type the following into the terminal:

```bash
#Example of day 1

node ./dist/d1.js
```

The days are names such that day 1 is called `d1.js` and day 2 is `d2.js` and so forth

# How to read output:

I am a very lazy programmer when it comes to my own tiny projects, and therefore the program will output solutions as they appear in the calender.
I.E. the first answer will be printed first, and the second answer will be printed second
